Experience
----------


Oct 2021 - Mar 2022
:   **Applied Scientist Intern**

    *Amazon Prime Video* - London (United Kingdom)

    Developed scalable machine learning algorithms for real-time anomaly detection across millions of streaming metrics. The proof-of-concept produced during the internship provided useful insights on how to improve the existing system. In addition, it contributed to the creation of an internal library useful to conduct future experiments and support scientific research.

    *Anomaly detection* • *Streaming data*

Feb 2021 - July 2021
:   **Applied Scientist Intern**

    *Amazon Transportation Services* - Remote (Luxembourg)

    Researched and developed multiple machine learning models to forecast volumes of packages moving across European centers. Improved the previous approach by discovering and mining multiple impacting features and proposing different ensemble strategies to tackle complex data distributions. The best performing method has been deployed in production to efficiently allocate the available resources.

    *Intermittent time series forecasting* • *Machine learning* • *Data mining*

Sep 2018 - Sep 2018
:   **Software Engineer Intern**

    *MyDev S.R.L.* - Forlì (Italy)

    Developed a website using ASP.NET, HTML5 and Javascript to allow customers monitoring remotely their networking appliances. Environments are rendered as tridimensional virtual navigable and interactive scenes.

    *Web development* • *3D Rendering*
